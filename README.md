**`Software Developer / Pilot`**

I'm a former airline pilot seeking a career transition to the software development industry. Here, you can find coding projects I've been working on. My projects follow a structured approach that begins with planning and design, and progresses through the implementation of code to address real-world issues.

 <summary><h3>My Coding Journey</h3></summary>
   I started my coding journey as a high school student with a passion for aviation and a curiosity about computer science. I enrolled in my high school's AP Computer Science course where I learned Java and achieved a 5 on the AP exam. While I enjoyed learning about computer science, I turned my attention to aviation as I graduated magna cum laude from Arizona State University with an Aviation Management Technology degree. After spending a considerable amount of time working in the aviation industry, I came to the realization that the frequent travel and constant change of scenery just wasn't for me. Although my love for aviation remained intact, I decided to pursue my interests in software development. I started researching and teaching myself how to code again and have been making significant strides in learning more about the subject. Ultimately, I hope to secure a position as a software developer that allows me to blend my passion for aviation and technology to create cutting-edge solutions that can benefit the aviation sector.
